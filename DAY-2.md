**Problem Description**


**Reverse an Array**

You are given an array of integers arr[]. Your task is to reverse the given array.

Examples:

Input: arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
Output: [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 1 4 3 2 6 5. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is 5 6 2 3 4 1.

Input: arr = [4, 5, 2]
Output: [2, 5, 4]
Explanation: The elements of the array are 4 5 2. The reversed array will be 2 5 4.

Input: arr = [1]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.

üß† Approach:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Use two pointers:

One starting at the beginning of the array (left) and the other at the end (right).
2Ô∏è‚É£ Swap the elements at the left and right pointers.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Increment left and decrement right to move the pointers inward.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Repeat until the pointers meet or cross each other.

**code**

    class Solution {
    public void reverseArray(int arr[]) {
        // code here
        int n=arr.length-1;
      int left=0; int right=n;
      while(left < right){
          int temp=arr[right];
          arr[right]=arr[left];
          arr[left]=temp;
           
          left++;
          right--;
      }
    
         
    }
    }
