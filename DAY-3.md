**Problem description**
Given an array arr[]. Push all the zeros of the given array to the right end of the array while maintaining the order of non-zero elements. Do the mentioned change in the array in place.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
Explanation: There are three 0s that are moved to the end.

Input: arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
Output: [10, 20, 30]
Explanation: No change in array as there are no 0s.

Input: arr[] = [0, 0]
Output: [0, 0]
Explanation: No change in array as there are all 0s.

**üß† Approach:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Use two pointers:

One pointer (j) tracks the position to place the next non-zero element.

The other pointer (i) iterates through the array.

2Ô∏è‚É£ For each non-zero element at index i, swap it with the element at index j, then increment j.

3Ô∏è‚É£ All zeros will naturally shift to the right by the end of the loop.

**Code**
        
         
         public static void moveZerosToEnd(int[] arr) {
            int n = arr.length; 
            int i = 0; 
           for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[j] != 0) {
                
                int temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[j];
                arr[j] = temp;
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
