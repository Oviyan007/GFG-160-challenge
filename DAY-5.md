**Problem description**

**Stock Buy and Sell ‚Äì Multiple Transaction Allowed**

The cost of stock on each day is given in an array price[]. Each day you may decide to either buy or sell the stock at price[i], you can even buy and sell the stock on the same day. Find the maximum profit that you can get.

Note: A stock can only be sold if it has been bought previously and multiple stocks cannot be held on any given day.

Examples:

Input: prices[] = [100, 180, 260, 310, 40, 535, 695]
Output: 865
Explanation: Buy the stock on day 0 and sell it on day 3 => 310 ‚Äì 100 = 210. Buy the stock on day 4 and sell it on day 6 => 695 ‚Äì 40 = 655. Maximum Profit = 210 + 655 = 865.

**Approach**



üß† Approach:
1Ô∏è‚É£ Traverse the array and look for consecutive upward price trends.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Buy stock on the first day of an upward trend and sell on the last day of that trend.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Add the difference between the buy and sell prices to the total profit.
4Ô∏è‚É£ Repeat for all upward trends in the array.

**code**

      class Solution {
    public int maximumProfit(int prices[]) {
        int profit = 0;

        // Traverse the prices array to calculate profit for all possible transactions
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            // If the price today is higher than the previous day, sell for profit
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }

        return profit;
    }
    }
